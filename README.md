# Quantitative-Bioinformatics-Final-Project
For Quantitative Bioinformatics I analyzed and classified the post-thoracic surgery survival outcome one year after surgery. For my portion of the project, I utilized machine learning techniques like random foresting, KNN, bagging, and boosting models to classify the dataset. I, also, constructed a decision tree to visualize the survival factors.
